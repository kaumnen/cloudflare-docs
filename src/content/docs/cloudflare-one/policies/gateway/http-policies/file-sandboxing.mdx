In addition to [anti-virus (AV) scanning](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/antivirus-scanning/), Gateway can quarantine previously unseen files downloaded by your users into a sandbox and scan them for malware.

If AV scanning does not detect malware in a file download, Gateway will quarantine the file in the sandbox. If the file has not been downloaded before, Gateway will monitor any actions taken by the file and compare them to known malware patterns. During this process, Gateway will display an interstitial page in the user's browser. If the sandbox does not detect malicious activity, Gateway will release the file from quarantine and download it to your user's device. If the sandbox detects malicious activity, Gateway will block the download. For any subsequent downloads of the file, Gateway will remember and apply its allow/block decision.

Gateway will log any file sandbox decisions in your [HTTP logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/gateway-logs/#http-logs).

## Get started

To begin quarantining downloaded files, turn on file sandboxing:

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. In **Firewall**, turn on **File sandboxing**.
3. (Optional) To block requests containing [non-scannable files](#non-scannable-files), select **Block requests for files that cannot be scanned**.

You can now create [Quarantine HTTP policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/#quarantine) to determine what files to scan in the sandbox.

## Compatibility

### Supported file types

<Render file="gateway/sandbox-file-types" />

### Non-scannable files

<Render file="gateway/nonscannable-files" />
